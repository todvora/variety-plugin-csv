## Variety plugin - CSV output

This plugin outputs results of Variety analysis in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (comma-separated values) format.

## How to run plugin
First download the index.js file from this Github repository.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/todvora/variety-plugin-csv/master/index.js
```

Then pass the plugin path in Variety parameters like this:

```
mongo test --eval "var collection = 'users'; var plugins='/path/to/plugin/index.js';" variety.js
```

If you downloaded the plugin inside the same directory, where the is located also ```variety.js```,
you can omit the path and call Variety like this:

```
mongo test --eval "var collection = 'users'; var plugins='index.js';" variety.js
```

## Delimiter param
The default CSV delimiter is configured to the ```|``` character. If you want to use another one, adjust the plugin configuration:
```
mongo test --eval "var collection = 'users'; var plugins='index.js|delimiter='\t';" variety.js
```
This will output results delimited by ```\t``` (tab) character.

## Hacking
If you want to hack on this plugin, just fork this repository and change index.js content.
